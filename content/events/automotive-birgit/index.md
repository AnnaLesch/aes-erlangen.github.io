## Abstract

For more than 10 years, automotive audio has been an important part of product development at Fraunhofer IIS. Our researchers, engineers and Tonmeisters dedicate their work to providing all vehicle occupants with the best sound possible. 


Today, we are one of the most relevant suppliers of automotive audio technologies and in a huge number of car models you can enjoy our audio products.

In my presentation I will focus on three aspects:

1. give a short overview of IIS products successfully implemented in the automotive market and explain underlying technologies.

2. present our Fraunhofer IIS “Automotive Team” to you and explain our development cycle turning ideas into products.

3. point out job opportunities at Fraunhofer IIS in our team.
