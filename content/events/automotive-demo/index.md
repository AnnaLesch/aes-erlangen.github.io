In our everyday life we perceive noises from all direction: in nature it can be a bird whistling from a tree or an orchestra performing in a concert hall.
Our goal is to bring spatial sound into the car to present passengers with a relaxed and natural sound environment - regardless the limitations of the vehicle cabin.

This is done
• either by intelligent upmix algorithms that process a multichannel upmix out of a stereo input signal in real time
• or through multichannel input content that is distributed according to the car geometry.

We invite the students of the AES Student Section Erlangen-Nürnberg to listen to three technologies in three demo vehicles.

[Sonamic Panorama](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/automotive/sonamic.html) -
[MPEG-H Audio](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/broadcast-streaming/mpegh.html)

In addition, we explain the HW and SW landscape used for our in-car technology demos.
We are happy to answer questions about our team, how we work and what vacancies we can offer.
