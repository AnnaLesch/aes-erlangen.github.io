## Abstract

Digital reproduction of the behaviour of analog electrical circuits such as synth filters or guitar amplifiers has been a common topic in music signal processing research since the mid-1990s. In the last several years the modern techniques of machine learning have started to be applied to this problem, producing very promising results. In parallel, the same time period has seen an explosion of work in the application of machine learning to solution of differential equations. This talk will give an overview of work in these closely connected fields, and explore how different application areas have influenced the type of solutions developed.
