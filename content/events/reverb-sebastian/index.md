## Abstract

Artificial reverberation is a classic audio processing technique to simulate the sonic effect of room acoustics by computational means. In contrast to physical modeling approaches, artificial reverberation does not aim to recreate the accurate physics but instead evoke a perceptually convincing or pleasing impression. Feedback delay networks (FDNs) provide a computationally low complexity solution to artificial reverberation required for virtual and augmented reality applications. This talk introduces digital, artificial reverberation basics, particularly FDNs, and discusses a few current trends and applications.

Sebastian J. Schlecht is a Professor of Practice for Sound in Virtual Reality at the Acoustics Labs, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics and Media Labs, Department of Media, of Aalto University, Finland. He received the Diploma in Applied Mathematics from the University of Trier, Germany in 2010, and an M.Sc. degree in Digital Music Processing from School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, U.K. in 2011. In 2017, he received a Doctoral degree at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, on the topic of artificial spatial reverberation and reverberation enhancement systems. From 2012-, Dr. Schlecht was also external research and development consultant and lead developer of the 3D Reverb algorithm at the Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen, Germany. His research interests are acoustic modeling and auditory perception of acoustics, analysis, and synthesis of feedback systems, music information retrieval, and virtual and augmented reality.
