The first event of the AES student section was a great success. Ulli gave an introduction working in the field of 3D audio. Among other things he went into details about the typical education of a Tonmeister in Germany, e.g. popular universities and specializations. Also the very diverse set of skills you can have while calling you a Tonmeister and his personal career in the field. Highlights of his work was part of the second half. For example he told the story how they made a live MPEG-H demo for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 possible. We were happy to have such a diverse audience from Erlangen and Ansbach with students, researcher and people working in applied audio. See you next time!
