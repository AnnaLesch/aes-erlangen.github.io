We hope you all had a good, happy beginning of new year! We just had the first orga meeting of 2022 and among other things discussed ideas for new events. If you are interested in joining or also have ideas please contact us.

We want to host a regular open stage where people can show-case their current projects, prototypes or what they are interested in. The event is without any formalities and no additional preparation should be required for a stand up. It should primarily help people to connect and brainstorm with others.

Do you have topic your excited about and want share with others? Then write us at Zulip [general/open-stage](https://aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/309333-general/topic/open-stage). Once we have two or more items on our list, we will organize one event.
