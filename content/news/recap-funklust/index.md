The AES student section visited last month Funklust, the content producer of the university. They not only have a radio station, producing reports and doing interviews with students, but also create video content about events in and around Erlangen. The Funklust team invited us to a studio tour of their new location in the blue building at the Main-Donau channel.

Funklust shares the building with the [Multimediazentrum](https://www.rrze.fau.de/medien-entwicklung/mmz/), which are situated on the third floor. They have their storage room in the basement: storing replacement parts but also a mobile radio station. Furthermore their server room and connection to the Fraunhofer radio broadcaster (where they send the live-stream for broadcasting to the air) is separated from the rest of the floor. All offices are on the ground floor, as well as the recording booth. Felix (our tour guide) explained the content creation process and illustrated how the radio station schedule is managed.
