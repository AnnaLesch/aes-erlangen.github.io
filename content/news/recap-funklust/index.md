The AES student section visited Funklust last month, an independent content provider managed by students from FAU. They not only have a radio station, producing reports and doing interviews with students, but also create video content about events in and around Erlangen. The Funklust team invited us to a studio tour of their new location in the blue building at the Main-Donau channel.

The radio station [Bit eXpress](https://idw-online.de/en/news65272) started in 2003 at the Fraunhofer IIS and developed into the [Funklust](https://www.funklust.de/) group in 2016. They share the building with the [Multimediazentrum](https://www.rrze.fau.de/medien-entwicklung/mmz/), which are situated on the third floor. They have their storage room in the basement: storing replacement parts but also a mobile radio station. Furthermore their server room and connection to the Fraunhofer radio broadcaster (where they send the live-stream for broadcasting to the air) is separated from the rest of the floor. All offices are on the ground floor, as well as the recording booth. 

Felix (our tour guide) explained the content creation process and showed us how the radio station schedule is managed. Beside broadcasting music, they have four different formats the `auftakt`, `mischpult`, `konter kaffee` and `die zwei ??` addressing personal or university topics. Their content differ depending on the season, during semester break they broadcast mainly music. Volunteering at Funklust provides important practical experience and prepare people for working at larger radio stations. 

Afterwards we joined the Funklust team at a barbecue in front of the building. We had some interesting discussions with the team and concluded our visit. You can find their full schedule and further information to volunteer at their [website](https://www.funklust.de/).
