Hi everybody,

Slack has served us up until now as our chat, but we decided phase out of Slack and move to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/). You can find us now at [aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com](https://aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com), the links on the website are already updated. This decision was made in the last Orga meeting, because:

 - Zulip gives open access to the data and allows self-hosting
 - easy integration of mailing lists
 - better structure for streams with [topics](https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics)
 - we are still small enough to make the switch without too much hassle

If you have any issues accessing the chat, don't hesitate to contact us. We will also set up a warning sign on the Slack channel for others. See you around!
