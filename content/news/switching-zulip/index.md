Hi everybody,

Slack has served us up until now as our chat, but we decided phasing out of Slack and moving to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/). You can find us now at [aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com](https://aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com), the links on the website are already updated. This decision was made in the last Orga meeting, because:

 - Zulip gives open access to the data and allows self-hosting
 - easy integration of mailing lists
 - better structure for streams with [topics](https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics)
 - we are still small enough to make the switch without too much hassle

If you have any issues accessing the chat, don't hesitate to contact us. We will also set up a warning sign on the Slack channel for others. 

## Small FAQ

> I already had an account on Slack, what do I have to do?

Chances are high that you're account was carried over, but not your password. (because this is not possible) Head to [aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com](https://aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com) and click on **Forgot your password?**. Enter your Email address and wait for a reset Email. Then login into Zulip with the usual URL.

> I have created my Slack account this year (2022) or haven't created one at Slack

In that case follow the **Sign up** link at [aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com](https://aes-erlangen.zulipchat.com) at with your Email address. You only have to provide minimal data, and after that should be able to login into Zulip.

> Pff I'm a bit overwhelmed with the new interface, where can I learn more?

No worries! You probably have opened the webinterface of Zulip, first take the tour of Zulip on their [homepage](https://zulip.com/). (and do the actions there in our group) Then view this short video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ADUqHDTKE). You should be ready to head into the [Getting Started](https://zulip.com/help/getting-started-with-zulip) section of their help center and learn more about individual topics.

If something is unclear, don't hesitate to contact us, see you around!
